  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or
  two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're  looking for
  eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me  whether you're a
  little girl or a serpent?'
</p>

<p>
  'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking for
  eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't like them
  raw.'

  'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down
  again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as  she
  could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and  every now
  and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she  remembered that
  she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and  she set to work very
  carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the  other, and growing sometimes
  taller and sometimes shorter, until she had  succeeded in bringing herself
  down to her usual height.
